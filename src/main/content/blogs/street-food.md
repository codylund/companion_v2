# Street Food Survival

It's easy on the wallet, but hard on the bowels. It's spicy pho dunked 
with unidentifiable chunks of meat. It's a greasebomb quasadilla
from a stall identifiable only by the cross streets at the 
intersection it occupies. It's seafood pizza (definitely not pizza)
prepared on the sidewalk over fanned, glowing charcoal. It's the ultimate 
sustenance for world travel.

Street food can consistently deliver a satisfying meal and 
introduce you to the peoples' food for pocket change. Just use common sense 
and follow these simple rules/heuristics.

## Always carry coins and small bills.

Street food stalls are generally ill-equipped to break large notes or swipe 
your credit card. In places like Mexico and Vietnam, a mind-blowing meal 
can be had for less than $1 cash- a small fraction of a bill typically 
dispensed by an ATM. Make sure to break them at an establishment before
hitting the streets.

## Eat where the locals eat.

Street food is the peoples' food. It's cheap and available to all.
It reflects the general culinary trends and diets in your current locale. 
Consequently, a stall crowded by locals suggests quality.

### But where do the locals eat?

While Google Maps and Yelp are amazing tools, technology won't be super 
helpful for finding the best street food. So, just ask the people! If a 
language barrier proves problematic, find a market or walk aimlessly 
until something triggers your senses.

### When in Rome.

The best stalls have regulars and those regulars understand the dining 
procedure. As an outsider, you will lack this tacit knowledge. Just 
figuring out how to sit down can be a challenge. Is this stool available? 
Do I need to wait my turn? Is this a line? Or are people just hanging out?

Be patient and curious. Eventually, you will make sense of the chaos or 
someone will help you (probably because you were standing in the way).

## Eat when the locals eat.

A sane person wouldn't eat a roller dog from a Wyoming truckstop at 1AM.
They also wouldn't shoe away swarms of flies to eat the last 
strands of rice noodles remaining after the breakfast rush. 

For the sake of quality and- more importantly- your health, eat food when 
it is supposed to be eaten. Ideally, it will be cooked to order by a stall 
pumping out dishes with the efficiency of a war-era assembly line.

## Beware of refreshing mystery beverages.

I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy a fresh smootie blended from fruits 
grown in the orchard on the edge of town, but be wary of any drink
containing unpurified water. If you aren't certain it has been purified,
drink at your own risk. 

Here, it is not especially useful to follow locals by example. Their 
immune systems have experience with the pathogens inhabiting the
unpurified water. This occurs by much the same function as vaccinations.
For this reason, a local can drink the water with no issues, but you take
one sip and subsequently shit your brains out.

## Say _hello_, _please_, and _thank you_ in the local tounge.
