## Never forget

### Passport

Duh.

### Padlock

Used for securing valuables in your hostel locker. Opt for one with a 
thinner bolt. The conventional high school gym combo locks will be 
too large for some lockers.

If you value your shit, don't buy this from the hostel. Most places will 
be totally fine, but there are some real sketchballs in this world. 
Unfortunately, budget travel attracts a lot of them. Inevitably, you 
will encounter some volunteering at your hostels. They sit with those
locks all day. Just saying.

**Bonus**: for compatible backpacks, a zipper lock. This will keep 
your belongings secure while walking/waiting in busy public areas. Plus, 
you can snooze comfortably on the bus/train without worry for sticky 
fingers digging through your shit.

### Backup debit and credit card

If you routinely withdraw money or swipe your card in tourist hotspots 
(we all do it), you will inevitably have your information stolen. When 
your account gets locked, don't be financially stranded with just the cash in 
your pocket.

### Wallet for your small bills

Stash your cards and big bills tucked somewhere secure. Those financial 
instruments are overkill for an ordinary transaction on the road. Keep only
small bills in your wallet.

**Bonus**: this virtually empty wallet will probably satisfy a hasty mugger.

### Stashable daypack

As soon as you shack up at your accomodation, you hopefully won't have to pick
up your baggage until it's time to leave for the next destination. It's extremely
useful to have a small, stashable bag for urban treks and day hikes. I 
personally use [REI's 18L "Flash Pack"][Flash Pack]. 

### Sunscreen

Your epidermal health is more precious than golden brown tans.

### Raincoat

 

### One really good pair of shoes

Bring one pair of shoes that can do everything. Something utilitarian but 
impossibly fashionable. Something that can be worn for a casual stroll 
through the park, a clamber to a mountain peak, or a night out on the town.

## Leave it at home

### Anything you can't live without

Damage, loss, theft, and general wear and tear are all bound to happen. Think twice
before bringing that priceless keepsakes and anything of value (emotional or 
otherwise).

### Travel guides (e.g. Lonely Planet)

These are heavy and, in my case, underutilized. They are good travel 
training wheels, but all the information is available online for free!

### The laptop

Unless you are doing remote work, a laptop is essentially just a bigger, 
bulkier version of your smartphone.

### The DSLR 

Unless you are an experienced photographer or pursuing photography as a serious 
hobby, bringing a DSLR and multiple lenses is overkill. 

**Hint**: If you’re shooting with a DSLR on auto and have no intentions of
learning more, save the weight of the gear and just leave it at home.

### Extra jackets, sweatshirts, shoes, or pants

When it comes to clothing, these are the bulkiest items. They are also 
don't make direct contact with the smelliest parts of your body. You don’t 
need to wash them nearly as often as your underwear.

### A big backpack full of shit

Nobody in the history of long-term travel ever wished they brought more 
stuff. Be realistic. You don't need five toothbrushes and you really only 
need enough clean clothing for a week between washes.

Please, stay away from the towering 80L backcountry backpacks. They are designed 
for carrying food, water, cooking utensils, and camping equipment into the boonies
for multi-day treks. City and village based travel is nothing like 
surviving in the wilderness. In my opinion, anything over 45L is 
excessive. I suggest opting for a backpack that is just a little bit too 
small. It will force you to prioritize the essentials and prevent you 
from buying/accumulating tourist trinkets on the road. For folks planning 
to trek at some point, you can always rent gear. The extra cost is more 
sensible than lugging around all that gear.
