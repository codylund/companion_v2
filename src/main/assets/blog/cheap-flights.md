# Be flexibile for cheap airfare

Assuming you don't regularly stay at the Hilton or total a motorbike, 
airfare will likely be one of your biggest costs (at least upfront). 
However, if you are willing to compromise on your dream destination and 
relax your travel dates, you can find some seriously cheap flights.

[Google Flights](https://www.google.com/flights) provides a low-profile 
feature that enables simultaneous browsing of flights to any destination 
in the world. Paired with a flexible date selection, this flight 
aggregator can reveal some really sweet deals.

1. Head over to [google.com/flights](https://www.google.com/flights).

1. Set your departure location. For "_Where to?_" choose "_More destinations_." This will redirect you to a map-centric screen full
of potential destinations and their corresponding costs.

1. Choose your ideal trip dates, but don't get too attached. They will 
almost certainly be generalized in a subsequent step.

1. Click the calander to open the window shown below. Choose _Flexible 
dates_ and your preferred range (e.g. 1-week trip in the next 6 months).
